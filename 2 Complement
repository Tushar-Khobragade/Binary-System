The 2 Complement is a method which is used in the binary form to indecate or represent negative numbers in the binary form.
It also allows any binary function to check whether it is positive or neagtive. which makes it for the hardware to work efficiently.
Like we can write any number in the binary such as 24. the 1 complement for this would be invert all bits of it to change from all 1 number 
in 0 and all 0 in the 1. Like 24 have binary form in 8 bit 00011000. When we do 1 complement we have to change like 11100111 this is called 1 complement.
When we have to write 2 complement add one in the 11100111+1= 11101000 which is 2 complement.
